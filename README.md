# port-scanner
This is a Scanner tools which helps you gather information about your target machine. Which port is open which is closed . Which service is running on which port and their versions. This information is assest for a hacker. Without this information it too much hard to exploit a target machine. If attacker know the service name he/she can find the exploit for that service if know the version then they can optimize their search result depends on the version it much easier than annonymous target. So this is very usefull for any attacker.
